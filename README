Stock prediction via blind internet trust.

This repo implements the model from this following applied maths paper:
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14697688.2018.1546053?journalCode=rquf20&

I have derived what I think is a correct closed-form expression for the
architecture described in the above paper, which is in `NOTES.pdf` (it's
$g_theta^1$ and $g_theta^2$, equations (14) and (15), if you're interested).
It was a pain.

Whereas Sirignano used LSTMs for the base regression models ($f_\theta$), we
modified OpenAI's GPT to take in a sequence of orderbooks instead of
tokens/embeddings/input_ids, and used a regression loss function with
adjustable lookahead. We also implemented hyperparameter optimization
(bayesian), and played with a few funky optimizers like COCOB, which doesn't
require a learning rate scheduler as it models the schedule as coin betting
(see https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07795).

There is also some really bad and slow code for orderbook scraping. Dont @ me.

There is also some vestigial code for scraping tweets and doing sentiment
analysis on them in an effort to get more features/alpha. We used MT-DNN for
this, which was on top of the GLUE benchmark back when we were working in it,
and it worked well enough.
