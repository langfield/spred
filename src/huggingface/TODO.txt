Move the permutation logic (how we take in a sequence, split it, get a sample mask, permute it, and generate ``target_mapping`) into the ``XLSpredDataset`` class. 
Convert the token/row_id tensors into raw data (price features) tensors. 
We need to make sure our looping logic over batches makes sense, and aligns with ``data_utils.py`` looping from original XLNet repo. Note that the original repo has us looping over ``data_len`` first, and then the batch ``idx``.

Need to figure out how why we're getting this Float/Double TypeError. What should embeddings look like? What is their type supposed to be?

VERY IMPORTANT: If ``bi_data`` is set to ``True`` in ``config.json``, then you must have an even ``batch_size``. Otherwise you will get very bad things happening. Put in an `assert`` statement to block this. 

The training script is not broken, it is just that the forward function does not currently output loss as the first element. Need to get loss. 

TODO: verify shapes of output from forward function.
