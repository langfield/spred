Done:   #================================DONE==================================
        
        Merge ``obds/`` from dev into master (and all the things in the 
        ``obds/todo.txt`` file).

        Create new dev branch for gpst modifications to implement 
        ``orderbook_notes.tex``.

        Begin implementing new model.
        
        Pass in labels via labels argument to forward function.
        
        Look at original OpenAIGPTLMHeadModel class to copy classification loss
        code.
        
        If the jump is larger than 6, set the label to the most extreme, i.e. 
        change to level 6.
        
        Only train the loss of the network when the correct conditions apply
        (if we condition on Y > 0, then only in that case, checking ground
        truth from the labels). (Achieved via masking.)

        building on this, we needs a mask for the ask labels, since we are
        computing logits of y_2 given y_1 = y_1, and we should only train this
        classification network for the true value of y_1 for each orderbook.
        therefore all others must be masked out.
        
        Make the other 6 model instances in ``train.py``.

        Figure out how to compute logits for classification loss.

        Add `torch.Tensor.view()`` call to reshape model forward output into
        a matrix for estimation of ``Y_2``.
        
        Rehash feature creation in dataset class to reflect the CrossEntropy
        loss over a flattened verion of the output space Y = (Y_1, Y_2).
        
        Fix output aggregation in return tuple of forward calls to model.

Todo:   #================================TODO==================================

        Add activation functions to pre-encoding, post-decoding, and lm_head
        layers in ``modeling_openai.py``.

        Fix loss computation for optuna.

        Veryify that class label locations in dataset feature creation match
        up with expected locations in outputs from model forward class.

        Fix type annotations and docstrings.

        Rescrape data.
